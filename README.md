# Exploring-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-with-Keras
A Convolutional Neural Network is a class of deep neural networks most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are inspired by the biological processes in the animal visual cortex. CNNs use special layers—convolutional and pooling layers—to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.
